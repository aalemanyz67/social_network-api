# Objective
Wanting to share your thoughts, react to friends' thought, and create a friend list? Check out my social network application.

# Description
In this application you can use ThunderClient or Insomnia to create, delete, update users. You can also do the same for reactions and thoughts. Application allows you to use a database such as mongoDB to store your users in a database.

# Installation
 In order to run this application, you will need to use vscode to download my code. Next, click on the server.js file and open up the integrated terminal. Use the command npm i to install all the packages you will need in order to make this application work. Once the packages download, you will need to use command "node server.js" to get a local surver. Last open up Thunder Client or Insomnia to generate the routes that you will need.

 # Usage and Future Improvements
 This application is greate for anyone who wants to create a network of users that can interact with each other. Eventhough you cannot see a frontend webpage with the app, this would be a good starter for the backend of a web application.

 In the video some of the routes stopped working therefore I will continue to work on ensuring all routes are functional.
